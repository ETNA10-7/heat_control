# ðŸ”¥ Heater Control System â€“ Embedded Systems Assignment

This project is part of the Embedded Systems Intern Assignment by [upliance.ai](https://upliance.ai/).  
It demonstrates a basic heater control system using the **DS18B20 temperature sensor** and an **Arduino Uno**, simulated on [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).

## ðŸ“‹ Project Features

- Temperature-controlled heater logic using **DS18B20**
- Simulated heater (LED) with defined control states:
  - `IDLE`, `HEATING`, `STABILIZING`, `TARGET_REACHED`, `OVERHEAT`
- LED **blinks slowly** for `STABILIZING` and `TARGET_REACHED`
- LED **blinks rapidly** for `OVERHEAT`
- Non-blocking LED blink using `millis()`
- Serial logging of temperature and heater status

## ðŸ§° Hardware Components (Simulated in Wokwi)

- Arduino Uno
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- LED + 220Î© resistor (simulated heater indicator)
- 4.7kÎ© pull-up resistor for DS18B20
